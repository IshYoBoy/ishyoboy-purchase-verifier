### Overview

IshYoBoy Purchase Verifier is a simple WordPress plugin derived from [Aqua Verifier](https://github.com/syamilmj/Aqua-Verifier) that modifies the default user registration page by adding a verification form using the [Envato Marketplace API](http://themeforest.net/help/api). In addition to Aqua Verifier it adds an option to use [MojoMarketplace API](http://www.mojomarketplace.com/api/v1/documentation)

Coupled with BBPress plugin, this will allow you to easily create your own Support Forum while still having all the default functionalities of the registration form that everyone is already familiar with.
